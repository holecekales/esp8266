# Experiments with esp8266
Attempting to learn more about this awesome little PIC. Multiple projets to be built.

1. Remote controlled robot. Either connected to the house WiFi or providing AP
2. Simple info thingy, for our kitchen (birthdays, etc.) Probably connected to other things

However the first thing i need is to install simple webserver. I want to be able to edit the code on the webserver without having to flash the PIC - it takes very long time.

## Projects
Simple web serving from node server, so i can debug the HTML/CSS/JS (not a ninja).
